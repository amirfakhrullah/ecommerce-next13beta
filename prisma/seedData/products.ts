      "Nodding to the Air Jordan 1 High Travis Scott Mocha, the Air Jordan 1 Low Travis Scott Reverse Mocha offers a similar Mocha and off-white palette but in a reverse-style color blocking. Its upper is constructed with a Mocha Durabuck base, white leather overlays, and signature reverse Swooshes. Hits of red on the Wings logo heel embroidery and woven tongue label gives a sharp contrast to the design's neutral look. From there, a yellowed Air sole adds a vintage feel.",

      "The Concepts x Nike Dunk Low SB 'Orange Lobster' continues a collaborative series that originally kicked off in 2008. In crafting the shoe's design, the Boston-based shop looks to the rare orange lobster for inspiration. Varying shades of orange are applied to the nubuck upper, featuring lightly speckled overlays and a tonal Swoosh outlined in white. A woven Nike SB tag embellishes the white mesh tongue, while a bib-themed pattern decorates the interior lining. The sneaker sits atop a traditional cupsole, featuring black sidewalls and a grippy orange rubber outsole.",

Similar to previous Travis Scott Jordan 1s, signature reverse Swooshes and hidden stash pockets in the collar add on to the classic design.
